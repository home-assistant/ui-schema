# Lovelace UI

Lovelace is a new UI approach for Home Assistant. It is based on a configuration schema that is [documented here](https://www.home-assistant.io/lovelace). There is also a [developer gallery](https://home-assistant-lovelace-gallery.netlify.com/) with all possibilities of all cards.

This repository is meant to help organize and track issues.
